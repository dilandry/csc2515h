## csc2515h class project housenumber


### Libraries Used
For now, we'll be using _Python_ and the
[Lasagne](https://github.com/benanne/Lasagne) library for developing our Neural
Network, together with Theano, numpy, and scipy.

### Setup
If your `data` folder is empty, please run `get_data.sh` from the `data` folder
to download the training and test set for Format 2 of the housenumber stuff.
